# Download opencv package according to your operating system

I downloaded 3.2.0 win pack on my windows system.

# find if python is 32 bits or 64 bits
In terminal open python, it will display the following sentence if it is 64 bits:
[MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

# copy cv2.pyd to anaconda depending on bit version of python

	if it is 64bit python:
		C:\Users\...\opencv\build\python\2.7\x64\
